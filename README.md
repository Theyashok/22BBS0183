ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:

As part of the Digital Assignment for the course Modern Web Applications, I have developed a responsive grocery website using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

The objective of this project is to simulate the creation of a professional website for small businesses, such as a grocery store, that is user-friendly, responsive, and engaging.
